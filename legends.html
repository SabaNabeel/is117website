<p>Tomlinson sent the very first email back in 1971; 
at the time, he was working in Boston at Bolt, Beranek,
 and Newman (BBN), a company that was instrumental in the development
 of a very early version of the internet, called ARPANET. As an employee,
 he was "looking for problems [ARPANET] could solve," Tomlinson </p>

<p>“My designs were so simple people assumed 
I just had easy problems,” says Radia Perlman ’73, SM ’76, P
hD ’88, a software designer, network engineer, and Internet 
pioneer. But in fact, the tough problems she solved helped create 
today’s Internet.
MIT prepared her for 
cutting through such complicated problems, 
she says. “I had a TA that I found very annoying. 
He gave zero credit for extra steps in a proof. .
That forced me to come up with clean solutions. All engineers 
could benefit from an annoying TA—it can help you in life to arrive at 
the clearest, simplest answers.”
